# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Installation

This repo uses [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to symlink configs into the home directory. Each top-level directory mirrors the home directory structure.

```sh
# Install a specific platform/config set
stow zsh && stow git && stow osx   # macOS
stow zsh && stow git && stow linux # Linux
stow zsh && stow git && stow wsl2  # WSL2

# Restow after changes (refresh symlinks)
stow -R zsh

# Also stow shared configs
stow shared
```

## Repository Structure

- `git/` — Git config (`.gitconfig`, `.global_gitignore`)
- `zsh/` — Zsh shell config using the [zsh4humans](https://github.com/romkatv/zsh4humans) framework
- `osx/` — macOS-specific configs (SSH agent via 1Password, Homebrew paths)
- `linux/` — Linux-specific configs
- `wsl2/` — WSL2-specific configs (Windows 1Password SSH signing path)
- `shared/` — Platform-agnostic configs symlinked on all platforms:
  - `.config/gitconfig/` — Git identity and per-directory account switching
  - `.config/ssh/configs/` — Modular SSH host configs (GitHub, Azure, personal server)
  - `.config/ssh/pubs/` — Public SSH keys (no private keys tracked)
  - `.config/lazygit/` — Lazygit with `difft` + `delta`
  - `.config/ghostty/` — Ghostty terminal
  - `.config/zed/` — Zed editor
- `scripts/` — Utility scripts (`until_failure`, `install_bfg`)

## Key Architecture Decisions

**Platform split**: OS-specific files live in `osx/`, `linux/`, `wsl2/`. Anything that works everywhere goes in `shared/` or `zsh/`.

**Zsh config loading order** (`.config/zsh/config.d/`):
- `00-env.zsh` — PATH additions
- `30-dependencies.zsh` — OS-specific (1Password SSH socket, Homebrew, libpq)
- `40-plugins.zsh` — Tool bootstrapping (mise, cargo)
- `80-keybindings.zsh` — Custom key bindings
- `99-commands.zsh` — Aliases and shell functions

**Git accounts**: Conditional includes in `shared/.config/gitconfig/main_config` switch between personal and work (Outcode) identities based on the working directory path.

**SSH via 1Password**: All platforms use the 1Password SSH agent for authentication and SSH-format GPG signing. The socket path differs per OS.

- If there is an util command tool or something that should be noted add to docs/tools-and-commands.md so is easy to know what tools are available. Only add the necessary ones so we keep it clean and only with the needed one.

- ALL CHANGES MUST BE JUST INSIDE THIS FOLDER, NEVER OUTSIDE IT.
